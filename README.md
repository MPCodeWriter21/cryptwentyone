Cryptwentyone\[0.4.0\]
=============

Cryptwentyone is a simple python package that provides simple cryptographic and hashing functions. They are written in
pure python and C, so you can take a look at the python code if you want to learn about the algorithms or use the
compiled C code if you want to use the functions in your own programs and have a good performance.
